This project provides the function of minting that takes two parameters an address and a value and burn function enable the burning tokens by a particular address and decreasing the value from total supply and address. It maintains the balances of different addresses using a mapping.

    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

     function burn (address _address, uint _value) public {
   if (balances[_address] >= _value)
     totalSupply -= _value;
     balances[_address] -= _value;
